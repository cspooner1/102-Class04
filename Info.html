<h2 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: rgb(16, 211, 152);">What is anime?</h2>

<body style="font-family: Comic Sans Ms, cursive; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color:#FFBD69;";">
    Anime refers to a specific style of cartoon produced or inspired by Japanese animation. Think of it this way: all
    anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. The art style associated with anime is very unique and
    recognizable. You're probably familiar with the large eyes, wild hair, long arms and limbs, and more. This
    exaggerated design helps the characters more easily express emotions â€” of which there are plenty in anime.

    Also adding to the emotional feel of anime are the technical animation tricks like dramatic closeups and zooms,
    intense lighting, and brilliant colors. But beyond its distinctive visual look, anime has endeared itself into the
    hearts of fans because of its complex characters and engaging plotlines.
